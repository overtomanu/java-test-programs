The refined launch protocol chooses automatically a starting point for our program, taking into account both availability and access level.

Instance main() methods should always have a non-private access level. Moreover, the launch protocol follows a specific order to decide which method to use:

     a static void main(String[] args) method declared in the launched class
     a static void main() method declared in the launched class
     a void main(String[] args) instance method declared in the launched class or inherited from a superclass
     a void main() instance method
